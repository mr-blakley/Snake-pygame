# Snake-pygame
## How It Works

- The snake starts as a **list of segments** (each a tuple of x, y positions).  
- The **direction** controls movement (right, left, up, down).  
- The snake moves forward by **adding a new head** and **removing the tail** unless it eats food.  
- The game **ends** if the snake collides with the **walls or itself**.
